		<p>
			We organise a retreat camp in the forests of The Castle-Crowsnest
			Watershed Natural Area (CCWNA) in southwest Alberta, Canada. The camp
			allows you to withdraw for two weeks from all the stresses of life in the
			city and enjoy an intimate connection with nature, meet new people and
			heal your inner self.
